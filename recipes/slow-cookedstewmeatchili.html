    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This hearty chili is truly a snap to prepare. After browning the 
        beef and stirring in the spices to give them a slightly toasted 
        flavor, you simply toss everything into a slow cooker and let the 
        mixture simmer all day. Garnish with sour cream, chopped fresh 
        parsley, and chopped red onion.</p>

        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add stew 
            meat and brown for 2 minutes, stirring often. Add chili powder 
            and cumin; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir 
            in flour and cook for 1 minute more. Transfer meat to a large 
            slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Add diced tomatoes, black beans, kidney beans, 1 1/2 cups beef 
            broth, onion, bell pepper, parsley, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, 
            garlic, and salt to the slow cooker; stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until beef is 
            tender, 6 to 8 hours. Thin the chili with remaining beef broth 
            as it cooks, if consistency is too thick.</li>
    </ol>
